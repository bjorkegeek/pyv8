Design goals for this fork:

 * Javascript strings should be represented as Unicode in Python 2

 * Unicode objects passed to javascript must work

 * JSObject should be more like bunch (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bunch),
   supporting the full python dict protocol, at least for read access

 * JSArray should support as much of the python tuple protocol as possible
